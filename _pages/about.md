I am a Ph.D. candidate from the [Institute for Health Informatics](https://healthinformatics.umn.edu/) at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), working with Prof. [Rui Zhang](https://med.umn.edu/bio/rui-zhang). Before that, I received my MBBS degree (equivalent to U.S. MD) from Fudan University in 2021.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **medical informatics**, with a particular emphasis on developing and applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for healthcare and biomedical data. I am passionate about extracting meaningful insights from large volumes of clinical and biomedical text to support evidence generation, enable knowledge discovery, and improve health outcomes.

## Research Highlights

### 🔬 Clinical NLP & Information Extraction
Developing advanced natural language processing systems to automatically extract structured information from unstructured clinical notes, enabling better clinical decision support and patient care analytics.

### 📊 Biomedical Knowledge Discovery
Creating innovative methods for automated knowledge extraction from biomedical literature and electronic health records, facilitating faster identification of disease mechanisms, treatment relationships, and clinical insights.

### 🏥 Real-World Evidence Generation
Building AI systems that transform messy, real-world clinical data into actionable evidence for healthcare improvements, regulatory decisions, and clinical research.
