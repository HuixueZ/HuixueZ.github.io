I am a second-year Ph.D. student from the [Institute for Health Informatics](https://healthinformatics.umn.edu/) at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), working with Prof. [Rui Zhang](https://med.umn.edu/bio/rui-zhang). Before that, I received Bachelor of Medicine degree from Fudan University in 2021.

Research interests:
I am particularly interested in the field of medical and biological informatics, with a strong focus on developing Natural Language Processing techniques for healthcare data. My goal is to use these techniques to extract and analyze information from large volumes of healthcare-related data, in order to gain new insights and improve patient outcomes.
