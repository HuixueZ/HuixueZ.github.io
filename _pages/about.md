I am a Ph.D. candidate from the [Institute for Health Informatics](https://healthinformatics.umn.edu/) at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), working with Prof. [Rui Zhang](https://med.umn.edu/bio/rui-zhang). Before that, I received MBBS degree (equivalent to U.S. MD) from Fudan University in 2021.

Research interests:
My research focuses on **medical informatics**, with a particular emphasis on developing and applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for healthcare and biomedical data. I am passionate about extracting meaningful insights from large volumes of clinical and biomedical text to support evidence generation, enable knowledge discovery, and improve health outcomes.


**I am broadly interested in both academic and industry research and am open to relevant opportunities related to NLP, clinical informatics, and data-driven healthcare applications.**
